# Valid Binary Search Tree
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, return true if it is a valid binary search tree, otherwise return false.
#
# A valid binary search tree satisfies the following constraints:
#
#     The left subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
#     The right subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
#     Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
#
# Output: true
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
#
# Output: false
#
# Explanation: The root node's value is 1 but its left child's value is 2 which is greater than 1.
#
# Constraints:
#
#     1 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 1000.
#     -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
#
