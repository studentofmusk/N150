# Coin Change
#
# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations (e.g. 1 dollar, 5 dollars, etc) and an integer amount representing a target amount of money.
#
# Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up the exact target amount. If it is impossible to make up the amount, return -1.
#
# You may assume that you have an unlimited number of each coin.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: coins = [1,5,10], amount = 12
#
# Output: 3
#
# Explanation: 12 = 10 + 1 + 1. Note that we do not have to use every kind coin available.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
#
# Output: -1
#
# Explanation: The amount of 3 cannot be made up with coins of 2.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation: Choosing 0 coins is a valid way to make up 0.
#
# Constraints:
#
#     1 <= coins.length <= 10
#     1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1
#     0 <= amount <= 10000
#
