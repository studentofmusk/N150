# Decode Ways
#
# A string consisting of uppercase english characters can be encoded to a number using the following mapping:
#
# 'A' -> "1"
# 'B' -> "2"
# ...
# 'Z' -> "26"
#
# To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above. There may be multiple ways to decode a message. For example, "1012" can be mapped into:
#
#     "JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
#     "JL" with the grouping (10 12)
#
# The grouping (1 01 2) is invalid because 01 cannot be mapped into a letter since it contains a leading zero.
#
# Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. You can assume that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s = "12"
#
# Output: 2
#
# Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s = "01"
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation: "01" cannot be decoded because "01" cannot be mapped into a letter.
#
# Constraints:
#
#     1 <= s.length <= 100
#     s consists of digits
#
